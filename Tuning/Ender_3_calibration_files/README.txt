# Summary

Pre sliced g-code for the Ender 3 to help find ideal slicing settings. Everything is covered in detail here:

https://youtu.be/3yIebnVjADM

These should be good to go for the Ender 3, as well as any other Marlin based printer that has a bed of around 200 x 200 mm or larger. Just choose whether you have auto bed levelling or not. All I have done is add or remove G29 to the start gcode.

UPDATE: Fixed the speed test, which was flawed because of a minimum layer time slowing down the perimeters. This was respectfully pointed out by a viewer, thank you!

Also added Ender 3 Simplify3D profile, which has been requested many times.
